Hello! I'm Rexios. I started programming with C++ when I was 13 years old and have been in love with coding ever since. In 2019 I graduated from Wright State University with a BS in Computer Science. Since then I have been a full time Software Engineer at [Aptima Inc](https://www.aptima.com), started my own company called [IO Design Team](https://iodesignteam.com), and have worked on several personal projects and open source projects.
