[Project Madad Maps](https://madadmaps.com) is a live updating map of hospital bed availability in India. India currently has no centralized method of showing this information. A Firebase Cloud Function periodically scraps hundreds of websites to get the hospital bed availability data and stores it in a Realtime Database for the website to access.
